    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="about-text">
      I'm a tech-driven B.Tech graduate from Sharda University with a strong interest in Full-Stack Web Development, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning.
      <br><br>
      I enjoy building smart solutions that solve real-world problems â€“ from Arduino-based systems to Python-powered applications. Recently, I worked on a hospital inventory forecasting app that uses AI to optimize medical supply distribution. I'm also passionate about integrating AI/ML into impactful projects and continuously expanding my skills in tools like Git, HTML, and data science frameworks.
      <br><br>
      I'm currently looking for internship or entry-level opportunities where I can apply my knowledge, contribute meaningfully, and grow as a developer.
